HIT_UI_01 - Canonical UI levels and glossary

This HIT standardized the frontend representation of backend enums and domain data. A contextual glossary was added with category-scoped icons and level descriptions, decoupled from business logic. Icons and presentation were organized per category and per level, aligned 1-to-1 with backend enums.

Garden plant bio attributes and tasks now render data from the BFF, using the same visual components and a contextual glossary triggered by user interaction. Legacy behavior was removed, layout was preserved, and mocks were replaced with real data where available. Tasks remain stubs but are visually prepared for future backend events.
