HIT_023 validated the entire end-to-end push notification channel for the Pais de Planta application. This HIT introduced web device registration, FCM token generation in the browser, backend token persistence via UserDevice, and real notification delivery through Firebase Cloud Messaging and APScheduler. The architecture preserved strict separation of concerns: DeviceService handles registration, FirebaseService handles delivery, NotificationService orchestrates status transitions, and SchedulerService triggers processing. The system was validated end-to-end: token generation, persistence, pending to sent transition, and real browser push receipt were confirmed. This HIT established production grade multi user push infrastructure without introducing architectural drift.

Friction analysis revealed important infrastructure and development environment lessons. Critical issues resolved included securing the SQLite database path to avoid parallel or phantom databases, eliminating incorrect root cause assumptions, correcting Firebase configuration and VAPID key handling, and adapting to service worker compat limitations. Open structural considerations include the absence of Alembic for schema migration and service worker hot reload limitations in browser development. Overall, the push channel is fully validated, extensible, and ready for integration with care events and user value features in subsequent HITs.
