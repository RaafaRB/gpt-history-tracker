HIT_022 implemented the foundational notification infrastructure for the Pais de Planta application, establishing a multi-user, canal-agnostic architecture based on Firebase Cloud Messaging and APSScheduler. New domain entities (User, UserDevice, Notification) were introduced to support device registration, channel-independent notification orchestration, and persistent scheduling. The architecture strictly separates channel (FirebaseService), orchestration (NotificationService), and trigger (SchedulerService) to prevent domain-infra coupling.

APSScheduler was integrated into the FastAPI lifecycle to periodically process pending notifications based on scheduled_for timestamps, while Firebase Admin SDK was initialized via environment variables for secure credential management. A manual test endpoint was added to validate end-to-end scheduling and status transitions (pending to sent / failed) without frontend integration. This HIT established the structural foundation for proactive care reminders and future event-driven features without introducing architectural drift.
