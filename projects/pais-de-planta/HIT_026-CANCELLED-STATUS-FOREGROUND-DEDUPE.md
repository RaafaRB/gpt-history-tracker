HIT_026 - Cancelled Status and Foreground Dedupe

This HIT hardened the care notification cycle and improved the in-app experience when push messages arrive while the app tab is active. On the backend, NotificationStatusEnum was extended with a cancelled status to support cycle correctness. The care schedule mark-done flow now cancels any existing pending notifications for the same care_schedule before generating the next cycle notification, preventing false or stale reminders. A defensive guard also prevents duplicate pending notifications for the same schedule and due time, keeping the data model deterministic under race or repeated calls.

For foreground support, FirebaseService now attaches a minimal, string-only data payload to every push, including notification_id, reference_type, reference_id, care_type, title, and body. This enabled a client-side dedupe path without changing background behavior. On the frontend, a listen-only usePushNotifications hook was added to register a single onMessage listener and display a minimal in-app toast (PushToast) when messages arrive with the app in focus. A module-level Set`dedupes by notification_id, preventing double toasts in foreground. Manual validation confirmed cancellation, non-duplication of pending notifications, and exactly one toast per notification when force-due notifications were triggered with the app open.
