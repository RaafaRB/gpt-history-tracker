This HIT addressed critical UX friction related to healthy diagnostics after real backend data was exposed in the frontend. The scope focused on preventing invalid navigation paths and restoring semantic clarity without touching backend contracts or routes. A celebratory, mobile-first modal was introduced as the canonical surface for healthy diagnostics, replacing legacy disease navigation assumptions.

Defensive guards were added across all entry points to ensure that healthy diagnostics never render disease or treatment surfaces. The result is a fully resilient UX flow: healthy states are explicit, positive, and protected against deep-linking, while non-healthy diagnostics remain unchanged. This HIT significantly improves product readability and user trust with zero architectural debt.
