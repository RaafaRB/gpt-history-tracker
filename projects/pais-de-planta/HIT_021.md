This HIT completed the translation of treatment semantics into a fully operational backend and connected frontend flow. The core decision that treatments are friendly suggestions, rather than authoritative prescriptions, was enforced across the architecture.

Anew GardenPlantTreatment entity was introduced as a snapshot of the canonical DiseaseTreatment at diagnostic time, ensuring historical immutability and rastrability. The diagnostic flow was updated to resolve and reuse canonical treatments while creating exactly one treatment snapshot per diagnostic. A read-only endpoint was added to expose this snapshot and a minimal mutation endpoint was introduced to advance the status from pending to waiting_for_update.

On the frontend, treatment display was refactored to consume the new snapshot data, replacing previously mocked or canonic behavior. Real-time treatment status is now refflected consistently across the TreatmentDetail, GardenPlantDetail, and DiagnosticsHistory surfaces. The result is a coherent, event-driven treatment flow with no domain ambiguity, zero backend breakage, and a clear foundation for future iterations.
