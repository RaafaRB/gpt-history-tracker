Project: Pais de Planta
Date: 27 January 2026
Duration: approximately 3 hours
HIT Type: Foundational / Technical Bootstrap
Objective: Full initialization of the project with governance, full-stack scaffolding and cross-platform automation, establishing a stable technical baseline for future HITs.

1. Context and Objective of the HIT
This HIT had the goal of creating the fundational technical and governance layers of the Pais de Planta project, before any product feature development.

The focus of this HIT was not to deliver features, but to:
- Build a solid and scalable structure
- Avoid common pitfalls of IA-first projects
- Ensure full Windows compatibility
- Define explicit rules for future AI operation
- Validate the frontend - backend loop from day one

This HIT is treated as an immutable baseline on top of which all future HITs will be built.

6. Final Status and Validation
Backend and frontend are operational.
Governance is active.
The technical baseline is congeled for future HITs.
