HIT_028 - UI polish for Plant and Disease Detail

This HIT polished the current UP presentation by addressing multiple small but high-impact issues across coring screens. The canonical plant detail experience was stabilized by making the display name (apalido ) the primary H1 and demoting the scientific name to a secondary subheader, reducing cognitive noise and improving hierarchy. In the garden plant detail screen, the "Ultima foto ha X dias" line was corrected to derive from the best available source (garden plant image timestamp when present, else fallback to the last diagnostic timestamp only when a snapshot image exists), with local midnight normalization to avoid hourly flicker. The status badge was unstuck from the legacy "Vivo" concept and now displays a clear product semantic state derived from the last diagnostic: "Saudavel" when no disease is attached, and "Doente" when a last diagnostic has a non-null plant_disease_id. As a small affordance polish, the bioattributes settings icon was relocated to the tasks area, replacing a chevron and better aligning future settings actions with task-centric UX. 

On the disease detail screen, the disease name was cleaned to avoid exposing machine-code text (translating underscores and hiphens to spaces and applying Title Case) while honoring a strict priority cascade: diagnostic display_title," plant_disease.name, then humanized plant_disease.code (or issue_code). Debug visibility was removed by eliminating the id/machine-code row and version strings from the view, keeping the UX clean and focused on user-meaningful content. Manual smoke testing confirmed that all touched screens render correctly, no console errors occur, and the frontend build succeeded cleanly.
